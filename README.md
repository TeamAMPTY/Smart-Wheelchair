## Features
Computer Vision Navigation: SMIFTY utilizes computer vision to navigate and intelligently move around obstacles, providing an enhanced level of autonomy for the user.

Object Detection with YOLO: The YOLO (You Only Look Once) model is employed for real-time object detection, allowing SMIFTY to identify and respond to various objects in its environment.

## Safety Features:

- Safety Belt: A built-in safety belt ensures the user remains securely seated during operation.
- Kill Switch: An emergency kill switch instantly halts the wheelchair's movement in critical situations.
- Fall Detection: SMIFTY is equipped with a fall detection mechanism to automatically trigger safety protocols if the user falls.
- User-Friendly Interface: The wheelchair is designed with an intuitive user interface, making it accessible for users of all abilities.
